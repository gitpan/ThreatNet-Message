NAME
    ThreatNet::Message - An object representation of a ThreatNet channel
    message

DESCRIPTION
    ThreatNet is an evolving idea. It's homepage at time of publishing is

    <http://ali.as/threatnet/>

    This module is an abstract base class for a ThreatNet channel message,
    and allows you to create objects representing threat messages in a
    channel.

    ThreatNet itself is not yet available and this module has been uploaded
    seperately so people working on ThreatNet can play with the various
    compenents in different ways before we come to a decision about what
    collection of modules will be included in a core ThreatNet.pm package.

METHODS
  new $message
    The "new" constructor takes a string containing the actual channel
    message and creates a new object. Please be aware that this method is
    likely to be heavily overloaded, so there may be additional
    requirements.

    This base class is extremely flexible and makes absolutely no
    requirements on the content of the message, even that is has length.

    For an example of a potentially more useful Message class, see
    ThreatNet::Message::GenericIPv4

    Returns a ThreatNet::Message object on success, false if the message is
    not a valid message for a particular message class, or "undef" on error,
    such as being passed a non-string.

  message
    For any ThreatNet::Messsage class, the "message" accessor will always
    return the message in string form, although it may have been
    canonicalised and might not be identical to the original string.
